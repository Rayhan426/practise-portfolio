            <h3>The Rangpur at a glance</h3>
            <p>Rangpur is a district in Northern Bangladesh. It is a part of the Rangpur Division. Area 2307.78 square
                kilometers. Geography Under the RANGPUR division (one of seven divisions) composed of eight districts of
                the
                northern Bangladesh, the District of Rangpur is bordered on the north by Nilphamari District,It is said
                that
                the present name Rangpur came from the former 'Rongpur'. History has it that English colonial rulers in
                this
                region started cultivating Indigo. Due to the fertile soil in this region, Indigo cultivation was very
                much
                profitable. The locals knew that Indigo by the name of "Rongo". So thus, this Region was named
                "Rongopur".And from that, the name of today's Rangpur has originated. It is known from another
                conventional
                notion that the name Rangpur comes from the naming of Rangmahal (Palace of Entertainment) of Bhagadatta,
                son
                of Narakasura, king of Pragjyotisha Kingdom.[6]</p>
            <h3> Early History</h3>
            <p>According to Hindu theology, the eastern kingdom of Kamarupa or Pragjyotisha existed in India, which
                included
                the present Rangpur region. During the reign of King Bhagadatta (15th century BC) Rangpur belonged to
                Pragjyotisha Kingdom. During the reign of King Samudragupta (340 AD) Rangpur was considered a "Tax
                state" of
                Kamarupa.[7]</p>
            <h3>Mughol Period</h3>
            <p>According to Ain-i-Akbari, the Mughal period Rangpur consisted of three types of administrative areas.
                Rangpur was conquered by the army of Raja Man Singh, a commander of the Mughal emperor Akbar, in 1575,
                but
                it was not until 1686 it was fully integrated into the Mughal Empire. The Mughal Empire was established
                in
                the whole of Rangpur in 1611 AD. Place names Mughalbasa ("a locality of the Mughals"), and Mughalhat
                ("local
                market") organized by the Mughals bear testimony to the Mughal association and past of Rangpur and its
                hinterland. Later, Rangpur passed into the control of Sarker of Ghoraghat.[8]</p>
